Reference scenario: BAU=10 used as reference.

A) Rank stability (Kendall's tau) of S_DOBI ranks by driver vs reference:

          8     0.903947 6.602004e-39          4
         12     0.898246 1.937466e-38          4
         15     0.822807 1.578210e-32          4

B) Frontier overlap (Jaccard) vs reference:

         10                     1.0                 12               12
         12                     0.0                 12               12
         15                     0.0                 12               12

Interpretation:
  - Tau close to 1.0 indicates very stable ordering of driver burden across service-time assumptions.
  - Jaccard closer to 1.0 indicates a very similar set of efficient days under different service-time assumptions.
