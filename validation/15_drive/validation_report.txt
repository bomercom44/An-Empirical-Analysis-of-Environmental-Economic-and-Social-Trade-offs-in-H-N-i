Reference scenario: BAU=10 used as reference.

A) Rank stability (Kendall's tau) of S_DOBI ranks by driver vs reference:

B) Frontier overlap (Jaccard) vs reference:

         10                     1.0                 10               10

         15                     0.0                 10               15

Interpretation:
  - Tau close to 1.0 indicates very stable ordering of driver burden across service-time assumptions.
  - Jaccard closer to 1.0 indicates a very similar set of efficient days under different service-time assumptions.
